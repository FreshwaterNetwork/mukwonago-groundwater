<!--This HTML is used in the render function to build the elements within the plugin. The render function first creates a
Dijit ContentPane to hold all the elements. The ContentPane is assigned a dynamic id upon creation. The render function
takes the ContentPane id and prepends it to every element with a declared id in this HTML before the elements are created.
The unique ContentPane id makes all the element ids unique and prevents duplicate id errors across other apps.-->

            Groundwater dependent ecosystems (gde) are systems that depend on
            groundwater inputs to support their natural flora and fauna. These
            ecosystems can occur in wetlands, lakes and rivers. One rare gde is
            the fen, a wetland that depend mostly on groundwater inputs rather
            than surface water flows to support the wetland. The Mukwonago River
            Basin in southeast Wisconsin has several remaining fens that need
            careful protection ***** edit text as needed ****
