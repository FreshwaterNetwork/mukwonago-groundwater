      Groundwater dependent ecosystems (gde) are systems that depend on groundwater inputs to support their natural
      flora and
      fauna. These ecosystems can occur in wetlands, lakes and rivers. One rare gde is the fen, a type of wetland that
      depends
      mostly on groundwater inputs rather than surface water flows to support the wetland. The Mukwonago River Basin in
      southeast Wisconsin has several remaining fens that need careful protection.

        A typical home uses around 200 gallons per day or 0.14 gpm, so a
        subdivision of 50 homes uses around 7-10 gpm on average. An irrigation
        well uses between 400 and 1200 gpm for 10-50 percent of the time during
        the summer growing months. The exact amount depends on the time of year,
        rainfall, and crop. Municipal wells might pump up to 700 gpm, however
        most would be less when averaged over an entire year. To put these
        pumping rates into perspective, a garden hose turned on full blast has a
        flow of about 3 gpm.
