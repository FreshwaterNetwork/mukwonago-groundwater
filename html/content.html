      Groundwater dependent ecosystems (gde) are systems that depend on
      groundwater inputs to support their natural flora and fauna. These
      ecosystems can occur in wetlands, lakes and rivers. One rare gde is the
      fen, a wetland that depend mostly on groundwater inputs rather than
      surface water flows to support the wetland. The Mukwonago River Basin in
      southeast Wisconsin has several remaining fens that need careful
      protection.

        A typical home uses around 200 gallons per day or 0.14 gpm, so a

        well uses between 400 and 1200 gpm for 10-50 percent of the time during

        most would be less when averaged over an entire year. To put these

      Drawdown (cm):
    </div>
    <div>
      A pumping well creates a cone of depression in the water table that is
      centered on the well. Here, drawdown is the maximum amount the water table
      is lowered over the area of the fen by the pumping well in units of
      centimeters. Because healthy fens are associated more with shallow and
      stable water levels and less with minimum seepage rates and because
      drawdown in fens is more easily measured than seepage, drawdown is used as
      the primary indicator of potential harm to the fen. Drawdowns of 20 cm or
      greater over the area of a fen have been shown to negatively impact the
      health of the fen (Aldous and Bach, 2014).

      Depletion Potential (%):
    </div>
    <div>
      This is the percent reduction in groundwater discharge to a stream, river,
      or lake due to pumping. When a well pumps, groundwater discharge is
      decreased since some of the groundwater is now flowing to the well rather
      than to the surface water. Depletion potential rather than drawdown is
      used as the primary indicator of harm to stream, rivers and lakes. This is
      because reduced groundwater flows are related to poor water and habitat
      quality. In addition, depletion potential is a more sensitive measure than
      drawdown because only very large pumping rates will cause measurable
      drawdowns in streams, rivers, and lakes. Depletion potentials over 5% are
      considered significant, and further consideration should be given to the
      impact of groundwater pumping on the stream, river or lake.
